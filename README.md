*a calm little break tool*

hi Kat,
<br>
happy holidays! i made this for you: a small, simple tool for taking a quick break.
<br>
<br>
it’s not fancy (still learning VS Code and building stuff), and it’s meant to be a pause when things feel fast, or when you want a moment to reset. nothing is saved or shared. 
<br>
<br>
hope it brings a tiny bit of calm to your day.
<br>
made with love 💗
