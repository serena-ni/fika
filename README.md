*a calm little break tool*

Hi Kat,
Happy holidays! I made this for you:something small and easy to use whenever you want a breather.

It’s not super fancy (I’m still getting used to VS Code and actually building things), but I tried to make it feel gentle and low-pressure: a short timer, a cute pet, and a space to jot down a quick thought or doodle if you want.

Hope it adds a tiny bit of calm to your day.
Made with love. 💗
