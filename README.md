*a calm little break tool*

hi Kat, 
<br>
happy holidays! i made this for you: something small and easy to use whenever you want a breather. 
<br>
<br>
it’s not super fancy (i’m still getting used to VS Code and actually building things), but I tried to make it feel gentle and low-pressure: a short timer, a cute pet, and a space to jot down a quick thought or doodle if you want. 
<br>
<br>
it’s meant to be a cozy pause when things feel too fast, or when you just want a moment to reset. nothing is saved, nothing goes anywhere- it’s just for you, inside your own browser. 
<br>
<br>
hope it adds a tiny bit of calm to your day.
<br>
made with love. 💗
