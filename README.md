*a calm little break tool*

Hi Kat, <br>
Happy holidays! I made this for you: something small and easy to use whenever you want a breather. 
<br><br>
It’s not super fancy (I’m still getting used to VS Code and actually building things), but I tried to make it feel gentle and low-pressure: a short timer, a cute pet, and a space to jot down a quick thought or doodle if you want. 
<br><br>
It’s meant to be a cozy pause when things feel too fast, or when you just want a moment to reset. Nothing is saved, nothing goes anywhere- it’s just for you, inside your own browser. 
<br><br>
Hope it adds a tiny bit of calm to your day.<br>
Made with love. 💗
